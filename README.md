Giflow is an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches.
It was first published and made popular by `Vincent Driessen at nvie`. Compared to trunk-based development, 
Giflow has numerous, longer-lived branches and larger commits. Under this model, developers create a feature branch and delay merging it to the main trunk branch until the feature is complete. These long-lived feature branches require more collaboration to merge and have a higher risk of deviating from the trunk branch. They can also introduce conflicting updates.
